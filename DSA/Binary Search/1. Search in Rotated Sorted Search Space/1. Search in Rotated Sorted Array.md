Given a sorted array (non-decreasing) of integers: nums and an integer: target, return the first and last index of target in nums.

**Example:** `nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3,4], target = 3; Output = [3,5]`

### General Observations

- What would the output be if the target does not exist in nums?
- Output: `[-1, -1]`.

- What would be the output of the following input: `nums = [1], target = 1`?
- Output = `[0,0]`.

### Brute Force Approach

**Intuition:** Can be solved as **2 separate problems:** **(i) find first occurrence of target in nums** and (**ii) find last occurrence of target in nums**.
  
Iterate over nums from left to right to find the first occurrence of the target. Similarly, iterate over nums from right to left and find the first (last) occurrence of the target.

**Algorithm:**

```
- run loop for i in range: [0, n): // find first occurrence    
	- if nums[i] == target: 
	    - firstOccurrence = i;
	    - break;
   
- run loop for i in range: [n-1, 0]: // find last occurrence
	- if nums[i] == target: 
		- lastOccurrence = i;
		- break;  

- return [firstOccurrence, lastOccurrence];   
```

**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`.

**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`.

### Binary Search Approach

Use the binary search algorithm to find the first and last occurrence separately. 

For the first occurrence of the target, keep on exploring the left search space until the algorithm converges to get the leftmost occurrence. 

**Algorithm:**

```
- low = 1, high = n-1;  

- while low <= high: 

	- if nums[mid] == target: 
		- firstOccurrence = mid; 
		- high = mid - 1; // another occurrence of target can exist on the left 

	// target < all element on the right, hence, explore the left half  
	- if nums[mid] > target: high = mid - 1; 

	// target > all elements on the left, hence, explore the right half
	- if nums[mid] < target: low = mid + 1; 
    
- return firstOccurrence;
```

**Time Complexity:** `O(logn)`.

**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`.
  
Similarly, for the last occurrence of the target, keep on exploring the right search space until the algorithm converges to get the rightmost occurrence.

**Algorithm:**

```
-low = 1, high = n-1;
  
- while low <= high:  

	- if nums[mid] == target:   
		- lastOccurrence = mid;    
		- low = mid + 1; // another occurrence of target can exist on the right

	// target > all elements on the left, hence, explore the right half
	- if nums[mid] < target: low = mid + 1; 

	// target < all the elements on the right, hence, explore the left half
	- if nums[mid] > target: high = mid - 1; 

- return lastOccurrence; 
   
```

**Time Complexity:** `O(logn)`.

**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`.

**Overall Time Complexity:** `O(logn) + O(logn) ~ O(logn)`.
  
**Overall Space Complexity:** `O(1)`.
