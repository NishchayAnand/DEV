Given a sorted rotated array `nums` with distinct elements, return the minimum element.

**Example:** `nums = [3,4,5,1,2]; Output = 1`

---
### General Observations

- What is the range of the allowed rotations?
- Range: **`[1,n]`**.

- Can `nums` be empty? What should we return in that case?
- **No**, `nums` cannot empty.

- How long can the array be?
- The length of `nums` can go upto  **2<sup>31</sup> - 1**.

### Binary Search Approach

<span style = "color: purple"><strong>Trick:</strong></span> <span style = "color: red">In a rotated sorted array, <strong>one half is always sorted</strong> and the <strong>other half can be treated as a smaller rotated sorted array</strong>.</span>

<span style="color: green"><strong>Shrink the search space toward unsorted halves</strong> while keeping <strong>track of the minimum value seen in the sorted halves</strong>.</span>

**Algorithm:**

```
- low = 0, high = n-1;

- while low <= high, binary search does not converges:

	- mid = (low + high) / 2;

	- if nums[left] <= nums[mid], left half is sorted:
		- minElement = min(minElement, nums[left]);

	- if nums[mid] <= nums[right], right half is sorted:
		- minElement = min(minElement, nums[right]);

- return minElement;
```

**Time Complexity:** `O(logn)`.

**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`.

> **Optimisation:** At any point during the search, if `nums[low] <= nums[high]`, it indicates that the subarray is already sorted. In such cases, we can immediately return `nums[low]` as the minimum element without further processing.
