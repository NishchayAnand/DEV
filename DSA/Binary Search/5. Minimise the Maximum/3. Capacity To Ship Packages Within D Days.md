A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within `days` days.

The `ith` package on the conveyor belt has a weight of `weights[i]`. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by `weights`). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within `days`days.

**Example**

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5

Output: 15

Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:

1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

NOTE: The cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
```

### General Observations

- What is the primary problem we are trying to solve?
- We need to split the `weights` array into `days` subarrays such that the  <strong><span style="color: red; background: #FFF1E8">largest subarray sum</span></strong>  is minimised. 

- Can `days` be greater than the number of packages, i.e., the length of `weights`?
- No, `1 <= days <= weights.length`.

### Linear Search - Brute Force Approach

The minimum weight capacity must be `max(weights)` to ensure every package can be shipped individually in `days = n` days.

Similarly, the maximum weight capacity can `sum(weights)`, allowing all packages to be shipped in `days = 1` day. 

**Key Observation:** The <strong><span style="color: red; background: #FFF1E8">minimum weight capacity</span></strong> that allows us to ship all packages in `days` days would definitely lie in the range: `[max(weights) : sum(weights)]`.

**Trick:** <span style="color: green;">If we start iterating from</span> `min_cap = max(weights)` <span style="color: green;">up to</span>  `sum(weights)`, <span style="color: green;">the first</span> `min_cap` <span style="color: green;">that allows us to divide the</span> `weights` <span style="color: green;">into</span> `days` <span style="color: green;">subarrays such that no subarray sum exceeds</span> `min_cap` <span style="color: green;">must be equal to the <strong><span style="color: red; background: #FFF1E8">largest subarray sum</span></strong> among the</span> `days` <span style="color: green;">subarrays, and is minimised</span>.

Run linear search in the range: `[max(weights), sum(weights)]` and return the first integer that allows splitting `weights` into exactly `days` subarrays.

**Algorithm**

```
- run loop for min_cap in range: [max(weights), sum(weights)]:
	- if can_split(weights, days, min_cap): return min_cap
```

```
- can_split(nums, days, max_cap):
	- split_count = 0, curr_cap = 0;

	- loop over each weight in weights:
		- if curr_cap + weight > max_cap:
			- split_count++;
			- curr_cap = weight;
		- else:
			- curr_cap += weight;

	- subarray_count = split_count + 1;
	- return subarry_count == days;
```

**Space Complexity**

We aren't using any extra space. Hence, overall space complexity = `O(1)`.

**Time Complexity**

In the worst-case scenario, i.e., when `days = n`, the loop will run for `D = sum(weights) - max(weights) + 1` times. For each iteration, `can_split()` will loop through the entire `weights` array. Hence, overall time complexity = `O(n * D)`.

---
### Binary Search - Most Optimised Approach

Run binary search in the range: `[max(weights) : sum(weights)]` to find the  <strong><span style="color: red; background: #FFF1E8">minimum weight capacity</span></strong> that allows us to ship all packages in `days` days.

> **NOTE:** If a given **weight capacity:** `cap` allows us to divide the `weights` array into **at most** `days`  **subarrays** , then it's guaranteed that we can divide `weights` into `days` subarrays.

**Algorithm**

```
- result = -1;
- low = max(weights), high = sum(weights);

- while low <= high:
	- cap = (low + high) / 2;

	- if can_split(nums, days, cap):
		- result = cap;
		- high = cap - 1;
	- else:
		- low = cap + 1;
```

```
- can_split(weights, days, max_cap):
	- split_count = 0, curr_cap = 0;

	- loop over each weight in weights:
		- if curr_cap + weight > max_cap:
			- split_count++;
			- curr_cap = weight;
		- else:
			- curr_cap += weight;

	- subarray_count = split_count + 1;
	- return subarray_count <= days;
```

**Space Complexity**

We aren't using any extra space. Hence, overall space complexity = `O(1)`.

**Time Complexity**

In the worst-case scenario, i.e., when `days = n`, the loop will run for `log(D = sum(weights) - max(weights) + 1)` times. For each iteration, `can_split()` will loop through the entire `weights` array. Hence, overall time complexity = `O( n * log(D) )`.
