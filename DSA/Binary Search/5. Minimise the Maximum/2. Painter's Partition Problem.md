Given an array `arr` of `n` boards of different lengths and `k` painters, partition the boards among painters such that each painter paints only continuous sections, and the total time to paint all boards is minimised.

> **NOTE:** Each unit length of a board takes 1 unit of time to paint.

```
Input: arr = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3], k = 2

Output: 11

Explanation: We need to split the boards into 2 continuous subarrays so that the total painting time is minimized.

[2]             Painter 1:  2, [1, 5, 6, 2, 3] Painter 2: 17 - max: 17
[2, 1]          Painter 1:  3, [5, 6, 2, 3]    Painter 2: 16 - max: 16
[2, 1, 5]       Painter 1:  8, [6, 2, 3]       Painter 2: 11 - max: 11 (minimum) 
[2, 1, 5, 6]    Painter 1: 14, [2, 3]          Painter 2:  5 - max: 14
[2, 1, 5, 6, 2] Painter 1: 16, [3]             Painter 2:  3 - max: 16


The best way is to split it into [2, 1, 5] and [6, 2, 3], where the maximum time any painter spends painting is only 11.
