### **Redundant Computations in the Brute Force Approach**

The brute force approach for finding theÂ **minimum window substring**Â involvesÂ **checking all possible substrings**, leading to severalÂ **inefficiencies and redundant computations**:

### **ğŸ”¹ 1. Checking Overlapping Substrings Repeatedly**

- Suppose we have found a valid substringÂ `s[i, j]`Â that contains all characters ofÂ `t`.
- Instead of stopping or optimising, the brute force approachÂ **still considers all substrings that start atÂ `i`Â and end atÂ `j+1, j+2, ...`**, even though these will be longer and thusÂ **not minimal**.

âœ…Â **Optimisation Insight:**

- Once a valid substring is found, there'sÂ **no need to extend it further**, as it wonâ€™t be the shortest.

### **ğŸ”¹ 2. Recomputing Character Frequencies for Every Substring**

- The brute force methodÂ **recomputes the character count**Â for each new substring from scratch.
- For example, when checking substrings starting fromÂ `s[i]`, the algorithmÂ **builds a frequency map from the beginning**Â for every newÂ `j`, even though there is a large overlap withÂ `s[i, j-1]`.

âœ…Â **Optimisation Insight:**

- Use aÂ **sliding window**Â with a frequency map to maintain counts dynamically, avoiding repeated recalculations.
