2. `justify-content`: Helps in distributing the extra free space leftover between items along the main axis. For example, `justify-content: space-between` will position the first item at the start and the last item at the end of the container, with even spacing between the remaining items.

3. `align-items`: Defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the **cross axis** on the current line. For example, `align-items` will center the items along the cross axis.
