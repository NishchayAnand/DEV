# Understanding Flexbox Layout in CSS

Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a **_one-dimensional layout model_** that provides an efficient way to align and distribute space among items (`flex items`) in a container (`flex container`).

The main idea behind flex layout is to give container the ability to alter its items to best fill the available space, allowing us to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
