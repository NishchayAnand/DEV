**Q. Difference between flexbox and grid layout.**

`Flexbox` is typically used for smaller, more flexible components or sections within an application where you need to control the layout along a single axis (row or column). It's great for aligning items within a container and handling responsive design challenges within smaller components.

`Grid layout`, on the other hand, shines when you need to create more complex, two-dimensional layouts with multiple rows and columns. It's suitable for laying out entire pages or larger sections of a website where precise control over the layout structure is required.
