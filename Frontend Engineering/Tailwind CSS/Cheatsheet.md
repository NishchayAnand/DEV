**`max-w-sm`:** sets the **maximum width** of an element to a predefined small size:  `24rem = 384px`.

> It means the element’s width can grow normally up to `384px`, but **not beyond that**, even if there’s more space available.  If the screen size is smaller, the element will shrink below 384px to fit the screen.

---

**`min-h-screen`:** ensures the content area has at least the height of the viewport: `100vh` <span style="color:red;"><strong>(floor limit)</strong></span>.
