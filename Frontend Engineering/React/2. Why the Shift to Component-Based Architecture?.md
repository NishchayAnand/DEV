While traditional frontend architectures like **`MVC (Model-View-Controller)`** allowed for logical separation of concerns, the separation often led to intricate dependencies and hard-to-follow logic scattered across `models`, `views`, and `controllers`.

React, with its **`component-based architecture`**, focused on a more general approach of separating concerns into smaller, reusable, and self-contained components, each dedicated to a specific part of the UI and its corresponding behaviour.

<strong><span style="color:red; background: #FFF1E8">Integrating logic and appearance within components simplified the mental model for developers, allowing them to handle changes to a component's state or markup in a single location.</span></strong>

```
function MyButton() {  

	function handleClick() {  
		alert('You clicked me!');  
	}  

	return (  
		<button onClick={handleClick}>  
			Click me  
		</button>  
	);  

}
```

The localised state management reduced the cognitive load on developers by eliminating the need to debug state changes across multiple MVC layers, allowing them to focus their energy on building the core functionalities of their components.
