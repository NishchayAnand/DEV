# Understanding JSX

Keeping the state and markup together required dynamically creating the whole view with JavaScript. However, using JavaScript for both state management and markup rendering
creates confusion for developers as it becomes difficult to separate the logic and UI concerns (difficult to understand which parts of the code are responsible for which concerns).

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write markup (similar to HTML) in their JavaScript code. By using JSX, developers can define the structure and
appearance of a UI component in a way that is easy to read and write, and that keeps the logic and UI concerns separate.
