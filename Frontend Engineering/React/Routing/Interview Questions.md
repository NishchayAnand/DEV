# Routing Interview Questions

**Q. What are the guidelines for structuring the URL paths in a React application.**

1. Pathnames typically start with a forward slash (/), indicating the root of your application.
2. Use nouns to represent resources in your application (e.g., `/products`, `/users`, `/posts`).
3. Use verbs for specific actions (e.g., `/login`, `/logout`, `/create-post`).
4. Combine both resource and action for more descriptive paths (e.g., `/users/edit/:id`, `/products/add`).
5. Maintain a consistent approach throughout your application for better user experience and developer understanding.

> **NOTE:** There's no single "right" way to structure the URL paths, so choose an approach that works best for your project.
