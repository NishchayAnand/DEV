# Docker Interview Questions

Q. What is Containerization?

Containerization is a process of bundling an application’s code with all its dependencies and runtime information it needs to run on any infrastructure.

Q. What is a Container Image?

A container image is a lightweight, standalone, and portable packaging format that contains everything needed to run a specific application. This includes the application code, dependencies, runtime, and any configuration files. 

It is essentially a blueprint used to create a running container.

**Real-Life Analogy**: Think about your mobile phone: when you download an app, it’s self-contained and ready to run.

Q. What is a Container Runtime?

A container runtime is software that executes and manages the lifecycle of containers. It takes a container image and runs it as an isolated process on the host operating system.

> Note: A container runtime is usually built into most major operating systems, including Linux and Windows. However, it's not always straightforward to use directly.

Q. What us a Container Engine?

A container engine (e.g. Docker) is a high-level software tool that provides an easy-to-use API to manage containers efficiently. 

It acts as a bridge between the user and the low-level container runtime, simplifying the process of creating, distributing, and running container images on your servers.
