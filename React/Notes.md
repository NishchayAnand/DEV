# Understanding React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) for web applications. It was built by Facebook to address the challenges of building complex and interactive user interfaces on the client-side.

Reactâ€™s value proposition is centered around few key features that make it a powerful and popular library for building user interfaces.

## Component-Based Architecture

While traditional frontend architectures like **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** allowed for logical separation of concerns, the separation often led to intricate dependencies and hard-to-follow logic scattered across `models`, `views`, and `controllers`.

React, with its **component-based architecture**, focused on a more general approach of separating concerns into smaller, reusable, and self-contained components, each dedicated to a specific part of the UI and its corresponding behavior.

Integrating state and markup within components simplified the mental model for developers, allowing them to handle changes to a component's state or markup in a single location.

Localized state management reduced the cognitive load on developers by eliminating the need to debug state changes across multiple MVC layers, allowing them to focus their mental energy on building the core functionalities of their components.
