The `useRef` hook lets you <strong><span style="color: red; background: #FFF1E8">persist a value across renders (unlike regular variables, which reset on every render) without triggering a re-render when it changes (unlike state variables, which trigger a re-render)</span></strong>.

```
const ref = useRef(initialValue)
```

`useRef` returns a plain JavaScript object with a single property: `current`. When you change the `ref.current` property, React does not re-render your component. 

This means refs are perfect for storing information that doesn’t affect the visual output of your component. For example, <strong><span style="color: red; background: #FFF1E8">if you need to store an interval ID and retrieve it later, you can put it in a ref</span></strong>. 

> **NOTE:** The **information is local** to each copy of your component (unlike the variables outside, which are shared).

**Q. Build a stopwatch widget that displays elapsed time in seconds and supports the following actions: `start`, `stop`, and `reset`. It'd be a nice optional addition to format the time to display in `hh:mm:ss:ms` format.**

The core functionality of a stopwatch include:

1. When the `start` button is clicked, <strong><span style="color: red; background: #FFF1E8">the stopwatch should begin counting time</span></strong>:
2. Clicking the `stop` button should <strong><span style="color: red; background: #FFF1E8">pause the stopwatch, preserving the elapsed time</span></strong>:
3. Clicking the `reset` button should <strong><span style="color: red; background: #FFF1E8">stop the stopwatch and reset the elapsed time to zero</span></strong>:

```
```
