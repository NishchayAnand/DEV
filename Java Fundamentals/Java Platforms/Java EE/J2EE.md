# Understanding J2EE

Sun Microsystems originally released Java EE in 1999 as Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE). It started as an extension of the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE), offering a standardized way to develop complex enterprise applications.

J2EE emphasized the development of `multi-tier` `distributed` applications using `container-managed` `components` adhering to `standard specifications`. Here's a breakdown of why it was such a significant approach:

- **Multi-tier architecture:** J2EE broke down complex applications into distinct tiers (presentation, business logic, data access) promoting modularity and reusability of code. This separation of concerns made development easier to manage, test, and maintain.

- **Standard specifications:** J2EE standardized a range of **enterprise services** by offering a set of well-defined APIs (e.g. JDBC, JNDI, Servlet API, JSP). These APIs served as the foundation for developing enterprise applications, providing a common ground for developers to build robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.

  **Components:** J2EE introduced a component-based development model for building enterprise applications.

- **Containers:**

- **Distributed:**
