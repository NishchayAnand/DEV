## Understanding Encapsulation

The process of designing your class structure in an object-oriented programming world is quite similar to that of designing your database tables.

wrapping up fields and methods associated with a specific type of entity into a single unit is called encapsulation.

implementation of an object should be protected from direct manipulation by the client.

Encapsulation refers to the process of keeping the complexities of an object's implementation isolated from the outside world.

The process of grouping related information and relevant functions into one unit, i.e., basically the process of creating class is known as Encapsulation.
