# Understanding Spring Framework

- Why Spring?

- Application server vs web server
- Java EE container vs web container
- managed by Corporation vs open source

Spring, a popular Java framework for building enterprise applications, addresses a key challenge of early Java EE

- You never need to know what implementation you're using, as the framework will inject your dependencies through calling a constructor or setter in your code.

- Spring is still using part of Jakarta EE.
- Specification (JPA), Implementation (Hibernate).

- Initially, Spring was based on one design pattern - proxy design pattern

- Spring use bytecode manipulation to generate proxies at runtime (bean magic).
