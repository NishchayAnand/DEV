# Understanding Java EE

Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) platform is built on top of the Java SE platform. It provides a set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and a runtime environment for developing and running large-scale Java applications.

Java EE applications are deployed and run within a Java EE container, which provides services such as lifecycle management, security, concurrency, and transaction management. Common Java EE containers include Apache Tomcat, JBoss/WildFly, IBM WebSphere, and Oracle WebLogic.
