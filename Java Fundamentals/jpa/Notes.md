# Understanding JPA

JPA is a higher-level abstraction for database access, built on top of JDBC. It allows developers to work with persistent entities and relationships using object-oriented principles, reducing the need for manual SQL queries and result set handling.

Hibernate is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that implements JPA specifications. It abstracts away the details of database interactions, allowing developers to work with plain old Java objects (POJOs) while transparently handling database operations.
