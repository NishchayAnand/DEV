# Java Fundamentals

Java is a `platform-independent` `statically-typed` programming language based on the class-based `object-oriented` programming paradigm.

It is largely open-source, with the `OpenJDK` being the reference implementation.

> **OpenJDK**: An open-source project that provides a reference implementation of the Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE).

Java Platform consists of three fundamental components:

- **Java Compiler (javac)**: Translate Java source code (files with `.java` extension) into **bytecode**.
- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: Responsible for interpreting bytecode into machine understandable code and executing it on your machine.
- **Core Java Libraries**: Includes a comprehensive set of libraries, providing pre-built classes and methods for performing common tasks in Java programming.
