# Java Fundamentals

Java is a `platform-independent` `statically-typed` programming language based on the class-based `object-oriented` programming paradigm.

- **Statically-Typed**: Variable types must be declared explicitly, and type checking is done at compile-time.

- **Object-Oriented**: Uses objects as the primary building blocks of programs and supports concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

It is largely open-source, with the `OpenJDK` being the reference implementation.

> **OpenJDK**: Stands for **Open Java Development Kit**. It's an open-source project that provides a reference implementation of the Java Platform **(Java Standard Edition)** for developing Java applications.
