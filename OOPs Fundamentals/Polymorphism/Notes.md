# Understanding Polymorphism

Inheritance is a foundation for polymorphism, allowing objects of different subclasses to respond differently to the same method call.

Duck typing is a concept in object-oriented programming that emphasizes the importance of an object's capabilities over its specific class. In Python, which is a dynamically typed language, duck typing plays a significant role. Here's a breakdown of the concept:

Origin and Analogy:

The phrase "duck typing" comes from the proverb "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck." In the context of programming, it translates to:

If an object has the attributes and methods required for a particular task, it can be used for that task, regardless of the object's actual class.

When you call a method on an object, Python checks if the object has the necessary method defined, not the object's exact class (type).

This allows objects from different classes to be used interchangeably as long as they provide the required functionality.
