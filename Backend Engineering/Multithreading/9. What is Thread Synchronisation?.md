In multithreaded programming, a critical section is a part of the code that accesses shared resources (like variables, files, or data structures). If multiple threads enter the critical section simultaneously without proper control, it can lead to data inconsistency or corruption.

**Synchronisation** refers to the mechanism that coordinates the execution of multiple threads to guarantee <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">thread safety</span>, i.e., ensuring only one thread can access a **critical section** at a time while others wait their turn.

Below are the core synchronisation mechanisms available in Java:

---
### `Lock` Interface

The `Lock` interface (part of `java.util.concurrent.locks`) is a core concurrency abstraction in Java that provides **explicit, flexible locking mechanisms** for controlling access to shared resources.

The basic outline for **protecting a code block** with a `Lock` object is:

```
myLock.lock();
try {
	critical section
}
finally {
	myLock.unlock();
}
```

As soon as one thread locks the `myLock` object, no other thread can get past the lock statement. When other threads call `lock()`, they are blocked until the first thread unlocks the `myLock` object.

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">ReentrantLock</span>

`ReentrantLock` is the main implementation of `Lock` interface in Java. A **reentrant lock** allows the **same thread** to acquire the lock **multiple times** without blocking itself.

In **real-world programs**, methods often **call each other**, and if both contains locking mechanism, the **same thread** may try to acquire a lock it already holds. <span style="color:red;background:beige;font-weight:bold">Without reentrancy, this would cause a deadlock, i.e, the thread would block itself while waiting for a lock it already owns</span>.

**Example**

```
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Bank {

    private final double[] accounts;
    private final Lock bankLock = new ReentrantLock();

    public Bank(int numAccounts, double initialBalance) {
        accounts = new double[numAccounts];
        for (int i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++)
            accounts[i] = initialBalance;
    }

    public void transfer(int from, int to, double amount) {
        bankLock.lock();
        try {
            if (accounts[from] < amount) return;

            System.out.print(Thread.currentThread());
            accounts[from] -= amount;
            System.out.printf(" %10.2f from %d to %d", amount, from, to);
            accounts[to] += amount;
            System.out.printf(" Total Balance: %10.2f%n", getTotalBalance());
        } finally {
            bankLock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public double getTotalBalance() {
        bankLock.lock();
        try {
            double sum = 0;
            for (double a : accounts) {
                sum += a;
            }
            return sum;
        } finally {
            bankLock.unlock();
        }
    }

}
```

> **NOTE:** Each `Bank` object has its own `ReentrantLock` object. If two threads try to access the same `Bank` object, then the lock serves to serialise the access. However, if two threads access different `Bank` objects, then each thread acquires a different lock and neither thread is blocked.

---
### Limitations of Only Using `Lock`

Using `ReentrantLock` alone helps with **mutual exclusion**, i.e., ensures that only **one thread** at a time can execute a **critical section** that modifies shared data.

But often, **mutual exclusion isn’t enough**. Sometimes, even after a thread enters the critical section, it finds that it **cannot proceed** because a **specific condition** isn’t met.

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Example: Warehouse Management System</span>

Let’s imagine a **warehouse** where:

- **Suppliers** deliver items to the warehouse → like **producers**.
- **Customers** place orders and items are shipped out → like **consumers**.
- The **warehouse has limited storage capacity** → this is the **bounded buffer**.

Now, let’s map this to **threads**:

- **Producer thread** = Supplier → adds items to the inventory.
- **Consumer thread** = Order handler → removes items from the inventory.

```
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Warehouse {
	private final int capacity = 100;
    private final Queue<String> inventory = new LinkedList<>();
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    // Producer adds items to inventory
    public void addItem(Item item) throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
	        while (inventory.size() >= capacity) {
                System.out.println("Inventory full. Waiting...");
			    Thread.sleep(100); // Wait a bit and try again
            }
            inventory.add(item);
            System.out.println("Added: " + item);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    // Consumer takes items from inventory
    public String takeItem() throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (inventory.isEmpty()) {
                System.out.println("Inventory empty. Waiting...");
			    Thread.sleep(100); // Wait a bit and try again
            }
            String item = inventory.poll();
            System.out.println("Removed: " + item);
            return item;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}

```

<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">In the above code, the producer waits if the inventory is full, but doesn't release the lock. If a consumer wants to remove an item (to make space), it cannot acquire the lock, and thus gets blocked. This leads to a deadlock-like situation where neither thread can proceed, i.e., the system gets stuck.</span>

### `Condition` Object

We can use a `condition` object to manage threads that have acquired a lock but cannot do useful work.

A lock object can have one or more associated `condition` objects. You obtain a `condition object` with the `newCondition` method. It is customary to give each condition object a name that evokes the condition that it represents.

```
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Warehouse {
    private final int capacity = 100;
    private final Queue<String> inventory = new LinkedList<>();
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    // Conditions for producer and consumer
    private final Condition notFull = lock.newCondition();
    private final Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();

    // Producer adds items to inventory
    public void addItem(String item) throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (inventory.size() >= capacity) {
                System.out.println("Inventory full. Waiting...");
                notFull.await(); // Efficiently wait for space
            }
            inventory.add(item);
            System.out.println("Added: " + item);
            notEmpty.signal(); // Notify a waiting consumer
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    // Consumer takes items from inventory
    public String takeItem() throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (inventory.isEmpty()) {
                System.out.println("Inventory empty. Waiting...");
                notEmpty.await(); // Efficiently wait for an item
            }
            String item = inventory.poll();
            System.out.println("Removed: " + item);
            notFull.signal(); // Notify a waiting producer
            return item;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```


Once a thread calls the await method, it enters a wait set for that condition. The thread is not unblocked when the lock is available. Instead, it stays blocked until another thread has called the signalAll method on the same condition.

When the threads are removed from the wait set, they are again runnable and the scheduler will eventually activate them again. At that time, they will attempt to reenter the object. As soon as the lock is available, one of them will acquire the lock and continue where it left off, returning from the call to `await`.

> NOTE: In general, a call to await should always be inside a loop of the form `while (!(ok to proceed)) condition.await();`. 

----
### `synchronized` Keyword

every object in Java has an implicit lock. If a method is declared with the `synchronized` keyword, then the object’s lock protects the entire method. That is, to call the method, a thread must acquire the object lock.

In other words,

```
public synchronized void method() {
	method body
}
```

is the equivalent of

```
public void method() {
	implicitLock.lock();
	try {
		method body
	}
	finally { 
		implicitLock.unlock(); 
	}
}
```

The implicit object lock has a single associated condition. The wait method adds a thread to the wait set, and the `notifyAll` / `notify` methods unblock waiting threads. In other words, calling `wait` or `notifyAll` is the equivalent of `implicitCondition.await();` and `implicitCondition.signalAll();`.

For example, you can implement the Bank class in Java like this:

```
class Bank {

	private double accounts[];

	public synchronized void transfer(int from, int to, int amount) throws           InterruptedException {

		while (accounts[from] < amount) wait(); // wait on object lock's single                                                     condition
		accounts[from] -= amount;
		accounts[to] += amount;
		notifyAll(); // notify all threads waiting on the condition
	}

	public synchronized double getTotalBalance() { . . . }
	
}
```

A thread can acquire the lock in one of two ways, by calling a `synchronized` method or by entering a `synchronized` block. If the thread calls `obj.method()`, it acquires the lock for `obj`. 

Similarly, if a thread enters a block of the form, then the thread acquires the lock for `obj`. The lock is `reentrant`.

```
synchronized (obj) {
	critical section
}
```
