A thread in Java goes through **different stages** during its lifecycle, which are defined in the `Thread.State` enum.

---
### NEW

`Thread t = new Thread(r);`: A `Thread` instance has been created but not started **(initial state)**. In other words, there's a `Thread` object, but no thread of execution.


---
### RUNNABLE

`t.start()`: When you start the thread, it moves to the **Runnable state**. This means the thread is ready to run and just waiting for its chance to be selected for execution. At this point, there is a new call stack for this thread.

In the **Running state** state, a thread (and ONLY this thread) has an active call stack, and the method on the top of the stack is executing.

---
### BLOCKED

---
### WAITING

---
### TIMED_WAITING

---
### TERMINATED
