In multithreaded programming, a critical section is a part of the code that accesses shared resources (like variables, files, or data structures). If multiple threads enter the critical section simultaneously without proper control, it can lead to data inconsistency or corruption.

**Synchronisation** refers to the mechanism that coordinates the execution of multiple threads to guarantee <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">thread safety</span>, i.e., ensuring only one thread can access a **critical section** at a time while others wait their turn.

Below are the core synchronisation mechanisms available in Java:

---
### Lock Interface

The `Lock` interface (part of `java.util.concurrent.locks`) is a core concurrency abstraction in Java that provides **explicit, flexible locking mechanisms** for controlling access to shared resources.

The basic outline for **protecting a code block** with a `Lock` object is:

```
myLock.lock();
try {
	critical section
}
finally {
	myLock.unlock();
}
```

As soon as one thread locks the `myLock` object, no other thread can get past the lock statement. When other threads call `lock()`, they are blocked until the first thread unlocks the `myLock` object.

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">ReentrantLock</span>

`ReentrantLock` is the main implementation of `Lock` interface in Java. A **reentrant lock** allows the **same thread** to acquire the lock **multiple times** without blocking itself.

In **real-world programs**, methods often **call each other**, and if both contains locking mechanism, the **same thread** may try to acquire a lock it already holds. <span style="color:red;background:beige;font-weight:bold">Without reentrancy, this would cause a deadlock, i.e, the thread would block itself while waiting for a lock it already owns</span>.

**Example**

```
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Bank {

    private final double[] accounts;
    private final Lock bankLock = new ReentrantLock();

    public Bank(int numAccounts, double initialBalance) {
        accounts = new double[numAccounts];
        for (int i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++)
            accounts[i] = initialBalance;
    }

    public void transfer(int from, int to, double amount) {
        bankLock.lock();
        try {
            if (accounts[from] < amount) return;

            System.out.print(Thread.currentThread());
            accounts[from] -= amount;
            System.out.printf(" %10.2f from %d to %d", amount, from, to);
            accounts[to] += amount;
            System.out.printf(" Total Balance: %10.2f%n", getTotalBalance());
        } finally {
            bankLock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public double getTotalBalance() {
        bankLock.lock();
        try {
            double sum = 0;
            for (double a : accounts) {
                sum += a;
            }
            return sum;
        } finally {
            bankLock.unlock();
        }
    }

}
```

> **NOTE:** Each `Bank` object has its own `ReentrantLock` object. If two threads try to access the same `Bank` object, then the lock serves to serialise the access. However, if two threads access different `Bank` objects, then each thread acquires a different lock and neither thread is blocked.

---
### Limitations of Using Locks

Using `ReentrantLock` alone helps with **mutual exclusion**, i.e., ensures that only **one thread** at a time can execute a **critical section** that modifies shared data.

But often, **mutual exclusion isn’t enough**. Sometimes, even after a thread enters the critical section, it finds that it **cannot proceed** because a **specific condition** isn’t met.

<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">Example: Warehouse Inventory Management</span>

Imagine a warehouse that stores products. Two types of people work there:

1. **Suppliers** – bring in stock (like adding items to shelves).
2. **Consumers** – take items out to fulfill customer orders.
    
Now, let’s map this to **threads**:

- **Producer thread** = Supplier → adds items to the inventory.
- **Consumer thread** = Order handler → removes items from the inventory.

```
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Warehouse {
    private final Queue<String> inventory = new LinkedList<>();
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    // Producer adds items to inventory
    public void addItem(String item) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            inventory.add(item);
            System.out.println("Added: " + item);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    // Consumer takes items from inventory
    public String takeItem() throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (inventory.isEmpty()) {
                System.out.println("Inventory empty. Waiting...");
                // Bad approach: Keep checking again and again
			    Thread.sleep(100); // Wait a bit and try again
            }
            String item = inventory.poll();
            System.out.println("Removed: " + item);
            return item;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}

```

This is a classic **producer-consumer problem**.

---


(e.g., wait until balance is sufficient).

Ideally, if the balance is insufficient, the thread should **wait** (not return immediately) until funds are available.

Why wait ???

```
public void transfer(int from, int to, int amount) {
	bankLock.lock();
	try {
		while (accounts[from] < amount) {
		// wait
		. . .
		}
		// transfer funds
		. . .
	}
	finally {
		bankLock.unlock();
	}
}
```

Now, what do we do when there is not enough money in the account? We wait until some other thread has added funds. But this thread has just gained exclusive access to the bankLock, so no other thread has a chance to make a deposit. This is where condition objects come in.

---
### `condition` Object


```
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Warehouse {
    private final Queue<String> inventory = new LinkedList<>();
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private final Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();

    // Producer adds items to inventory
    public void addItem(String item) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            inventory.add(item);
            System.out.println("Added: " + item);
            notEmpty.signal(); // Notify waiting consumers
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    // Consumer takes items from inventory
    public String takeItem() throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (inventory.isEmpty()) {
                System.out.println("Inventory empty. Waiting...");
                notEmpty.await(); // Wait until stock is available
            }
            String item = inventory.poll();
            System.out.println("Removed: " + item);
            return item;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}

```


You use a `condition` object to manage threads that have acquired a lock but cannot do useful work.

A lock object can have one or more associated `condition` objects. You obtain a `condition object` with the `newCondition` method. It is customary to give each condition object a name that evokes the condition that it represents.

```
class Bank {
	. . .
	private Condition sufficientFunds;

	public Bank() {
		. . .
		sufficientFunds = bankLock.newCondition();
	}
	. . .
}
```

If the transfer method finds that sufficient funds are not available, it calls `sufficientFunds.await();`. The current thread is now blocked and gives up the lock. This lets in another thread that can, we hope, increase the account balance.

There is an essential difference between a thread that is waiting to acquire a lock and a thread that has called `await`. Once a thread calls the await method, it enters a wait set for that condition. The thread is not unblocked when the lock is available. Instead, it stays blocked until another thread has called the signalAll method on the same condition.

When another thread transfers money, then it should call `sufficientFunds.signalAll();`. This call unblocks all threads that are waiting for the condition. When the threads are removed from the wait set, they are again runnable and the scheduler will eventually activate them again. At that time, they will attempt to reenter the object. As soon as the lock is available, one of them will acquire the lock and continue where it left off, returning from the call to `await`.

```
public void transfer(int from, int to, int amount) {
	bankLock.lock();
	try {
		while (accounts[from] < amount) sufficientFunds.await();
		// transfer funds
		. . .
		sufficientFunds.signalAll();
	}
	finally {
		bankLock.unlock();
	}
}
```

> NOTE: In general, a call to await should always be inside a loop of the form `while (!(ok to proceed)) condition.await();`.

## Synchronisation Mechanisms in Java

Java offers two mechanisms for protecting a code block from concurrent access:

1. **`synchronized` keyword** – An older, simpler approach that automatically locks the code block and manages thread waiting using a built-in condition (monitor).

2. **`ReentrantLock` (JDK 5+)** – A newer and more flexible option that allows manual locking, timed waits, and multiple condition variables.

> **NOTE:** Learning `ReentrantLock` first can make it easier to understand how locking and thread coordination work, since it separates those concerns clearly.

----
### `synchronized` Keyword

every object in Java has an implicit lock. If a method is declared with the `synchronized` keyword, then the object’s lock protects the entire method. That is, to call the method, a thread must acquire the object lock.

In other words,

```
public synchronized void method() {
	method body
}
```

is the equivalent of

```
public void method() {
	implicitLock.lock();
	try {
		method body
	}
	finally { 
		implicitLock.unlock(); 
	}
}
```

The implicit object lock has a single associated condition. The wait method adds a thread to the wait set, and the `notifyAll` / `notify` methods unblock waiting threads. In other words, calling `wait` or `notifyAll` is the equivalent of `implicitCondition.await();` and `implicitCondition.signalAll();`.

For example, you can implement the Bank class in Java like this:

```
class Bank {

	private double accounts[];

	public synchronized void transfer(int from, int to, int amount) throws           InterruptedException {

		while (accounts[from] < amount) wait(); // wait on object lock's single                                                     condition
		accounts[from] -= amount;
		accounts[to] += amount;
		notifyAll(); // notify all threads waiting on the condition
	}

	public synchronized double getTotalBalance() { . . . }
	
}
```

A thread can acquire the lock in one of two ways, by calling a `synchronized` method or by entering a `synchronized` block. If the thread calls `obj.method()`, it acquires the lock for `obj`. 

Similarly, if a thread enters a block of the form, then the thread acquires the lock for `obj`. The lock is `reentrant`.

```
synchronized (obj) {
	critical section
}
```
