**Problem Link:** [Leetcode 1226](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-dining-philosophers/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=concurrency) | **Difficulty:** #Hard

Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

Each philosopher thinks for a while, then tries to eat spaghetti. However, a philosopher can only eat when they have both **left** and **right** forks. 

After eating, they need to put down both forks (and start thinking again) so that the forks become available to others. 

> **NOTE:** Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space, i.e., an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.

### Problem Statement

Each philosopher runs as a separate thread and repeatedly calls the method: **`void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork)`**. 

```
class DiningPhilosophers {

	public DiningPhilosophers() {}

	// call the run() method of any runnable to execute its code
	public void wantsToEat(
		int philosopher,        // id of the philosopher who wants to eat
		Runnable pickLeftFork,  // function to pick the left fork
		Runnable pickRightFork, // function to pick the right fork
		Runnable eat,           // function to let the philosopher eat once he                                      has picked both forks
		Runnable putLeftFork,   // function to put down the left fork
		Runnable putRightFork   // function to put down the right fork
	) throws InterruptedException {
		...
	}

}
```

Implement the **`wantsToEat()`** function <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">ensuring no philosopher starves, i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think</span>.

---
### General Observations

concurrent algorithm - no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.

Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.


Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher.
