In multithreaded programming, a critical section is a part of the code that accesses shared resources (like variables, files, or data structures). If multiple threads enter the critical section simultaneously without proper control, it can lead to data inconsistency or corruption.

**Synchronisation** refers to a mechanism that ensures that only one thread at a time can execute the critical section, while other threads wait their turn.

---
## Synchronisation Mechanisms in Java

Java offers two ways to prevent multiple threads from accessing the same code at the same time:

1. **`synchronized` keyword** – An older, simpler approach that automatically locks the code block and manages thread waiting using a built-in condition (monitor).

2. **`ReentrantLock` (JDK 5+)** – A newer and more flexible option that allows manual locking, timed waits, and multiple condition variables.

> **NOTE:** Learning `ReentrantLock` first can make it easier to understand how locking and thread coordination work, since it separates those concerns clearly.

---
### `ReentrantLock`

The basic outline for protecting a code block with a ReentrantLock is:

```
myLock.lock(); // a ReentrantLock object
try {
	critical section
}
finally {
	myLock.unlock();
}
```

As soon as one thread locks the lock object, no other thread can get past the lock statement. When other threads call lock, they are blocked until the first thread unlocks the lock object.

**Example**

```
public class Bank {

	private Lock bankLock = new ReentrantLock();

	public void transfer(int from, int to, int amount) {
		bankLock.lock();
		try {
			if (accounts[from] < amount) return;
			System.out.print(Thread.currentThread());
			accounts[from] -= amount;
			System.out.printf(" %10.2f from %d to %d", amount, from, to);
			accounts[to] += amount;
			System.out.printf(" Total Balance: %10.2f%n", getTotalBalance());
		}
		finally {
			bankLock.unlock();
		}
	}
	
}
```

> **NOTE:** Each `Bank` object has its own `ReentrantLock` object. If two threads try to access the same `Bank` object, then the lock serves to serialise the access. However, if two threads access different `Bank` objects, then each thread acquires a different lock and neither thread is blocked. This is as it should be, because the threads cannot interfere with another when they manipulate different `Bank` instances.

---
### Limitations with Locks

Often, a thread enters a critical section, only to discover that it can’t proceed until a condition is fulfilled. For example, we cannot use code like:

```
if (bank.getBalance(from) >= amount) {
	bank.transfer(from, to, amount);
}
```

It is entirely possible that the current thread will be deactivated between the successful outcome of the test and the call to transfer.

```
if (bank.getBalance(from) >= amount) {
	// thread might be deactivated at this point
	bank.transfer(from, to, amount);
}
```

By the time the thread is running again, the account balance may have fallen below the withdrawal amount. <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">You must make sure that the thread cannot be interrupted between the test and the insertion.</span>

You do so by protecting both the test and the transfer action with a lock:

```
public void transfer(int from, int to, int amount) {
	bankLock.lock();
	try {
		while (accounts[from] < amount) {
		// wait
		. . .
		}
		// transfer funds
		. . .
	}
	finally {
		bankLock.unlock();
	}
}
```

Now, what do we do when there is not enough money in the account? We wait until some other thread has added funds. But this thread has just gained exclusive access to the bankLock, so no other thread has a chance to make a deposit. This is where condition objects come in.

---
### `condition` Object

You use a `condition` object to manage threads that have acquired a lock but cannot do useful work.

A lock object can have one or more associated `condition` objects. You obtain a `condition object` with the `newCondition` method. It is customary to give each condition object a name that evokes the condition that it represents.

```
class Bank {
	. . .
	private Condition sufficientFunds;

	public Bank() {
		. . .
		sufficientFunds = bankLock.newCondition();
	}
	. . .
}
```

If the transfer method finds that sufficient funds are not available, it calls `sufficientFunds.await();`. The current thread is now blocked and gives up the lock. This lets in another thread that can, we hope, increase the account balance.

There is an essential difference between a thread that is waiting to acquire a lock and a thread that has called `await`. Once a thread calls the await method, it enters a wait set for that condition. The thread is not unblocked when the lock is available. Instead, it stays blocked until another thread has called the signalAll method on the same condition.

When another thread transfers money, then it should call `sufficientFunds.signalAll();`. This call unblocks all threads that are waiting for the condition. When the threads are removed from the wait set, they are again runnable and the scheduler will eventually activate them again. At that time, they will attempt to reenter the object. As soon as the lock is available, one of them will acquire the lock and continue where it left off, returning from the call to `await`.

```
public void transfer(int from, int to, int amount) {
	bankLock.lock();
	try {
		while (accounts[from] < amount) sufficientFunds.await();
		// transfer funds
		. . .
		sufficientFunds.signalAll();
	}
	finally {
		bankLock.unlock();
	}
}
```

> NOTE: In general, a call to await should always be inside a loop of the form `while (!(ok to proceed)) condition.await();`. 

---
### `synchronized` Keyword

every object in Java has an implicit lock. If a method is declared with the `synchronized` keyword, then the object’s lock protects the entire method. That is, to call the method, a thread must acquire the object lock.

In other words,

```
public synchronized void method() {
	method body
}
```

is the equivalent of

```
public void method() {
	implicitLock.lock();
	try {
		method body
	}
	finally { 
		implicitLock.unlock(); 
	}
}
```

The implicit object lock has a single associated condition. The wait method adds a thread to the wait set, and the `notifyAll` / `notify` methods unblock waiting threads. In other words, calling `wait` or `notifyAll` is the equivalent of `implicitCondition.await();` and `implicitCondition.signalAll();`.

For example, you can implement the Bank class in Java like this:

```
class Bank {

	private double accounts[];

	public synchronized void transfer(int from, int to, int amount) throws           InterruptedException {

		while (accounts[from] < amount) wait(); // wait on object lock's single                                                     condition
		accounts[from] -= amount;
		accounts[to] += amount;
		notifyAll(); // notify all threads waiting on the condition
	}

	public synchronized double getTotalBalance() { . . . }
	
}
```

A thread can acquire the lock in one of two ways, by calling a `synchronized` method or by entering a `synchronized` block. If the thread calls `obj.method()`, it acquires the lock for `obj`. 

Similarly, if a thread enters a block of the form, then the thread acquires the lock for `obj`. The lock is `reentrant`.

```
synchronized (obj) {
	critical section
}
```
