The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) states that <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">"A software should be open for extension but closed for modification"</span>.

The goal is make classes resilient. This is good because it allows later for new features to be added to classes without changing existing code.

Here's another way to think about this principle: <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">"Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that don't"</span>.

Identifying variability and isolating it from stable parts of the code allows for future changes to be implemented through extensions without modifying the core functionality.

---

Applying this principle is actually a combination of applying `encapsulation` and `abstraction`. The behaviour that stays the same is abstracted into a base class and locked for modification.

---

The OCP is one of the driving forces behind the architecture of systems. The goal is to make the system easy to extend without incurring a high impact of change. This goal is accompanished by **dividing the system into components, and arranging those components into a dependency hierarchy that protects the higher-level components from changes in lower-level components.**
