The **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** states that <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">"subtypes must be substitutable for their base types"</span>.

For example, if a method accepts a `List`, the caller should be able to pass in an `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, or any other implementation of the `List` interface, and the method should still behave correctly.

### **Why “IS-A” Is Not Always Enough**?

While it’s common in object-oriented programming to think in terms of an **"IS-A" relationship**, LSP warns that this **logical relationship isn't always sufficient** for good software design. 

Inheritance based purely on **taxonomy**, without considering behaviour can lead to fragile, error-prone code. This means that just because two things **look related conceptually** doesn’t mean they should share a **parent-child relationship** in code, unless their behaviour also matches.

**Example: Ostrich IS-A Bird**

Let’s say you start with a `Bird` class:

```
class Bird {
    void fly() {
        System.out.println("Bird is flying");
    }
}
```

This works great for most birds like `Sparrow`, `Eagle`, `Pigeon`, etc.

```
class Sparrow extends Bird { }
```

But then someone adds:

```
class Ostrich extends Bird {
    @Override
    void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Ostriches can't fly!");
    }
}
```

Now we’ve got a problem. If your code assumes all birds can fly, like this:

```
public void makeBirdFly(Bird bird) {
    bird.fly();
}
```

And you pass in:

```
makeBirdFly(new Ostrich()); // Runtime crash!
```

The program breaks. Even though an ostrich **is-a** bird in real life, it **cannot substitute** for a `Bird` in this program **without breaking the logic**. 

> **NOTE:** If substituting a subclass for a superclass causes incorrect results, unexpected behaviour, or runtime errors, then it **violates LSP**, even if the inheritance hierarchy appears correct.

---
### **Rethinking Inheritance**

LSP provides essential guidance on how to use **inheritance** properly in object-oriented design. It states that <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">"A subclass should only extend a superclass if it can fully honor the behaviour and guarantees of that superclass"</span>. 

**Example: Ostrich IS-A Bird, Not-A FlyingBird**

Instead of assuming all birds can fly, you **separate behaviour from identity**:

```
class Bird {
    void layEggs() {
        System.out.println("Laying eggs");
    }
}

class FlyingBird extends Bird {
    void fly() {
        System.out.println("Flying");
    }
}

class Sparrow extends FlyingBird { }

class Ostrich extends Bird { }
```

Now, code that expects flight uses `FlyingBird`, and code that works with all birds uses `Bird`. You’ve **preserved substitutability**, i.e., passing an `Ostrich` to something expecting a `Bird` works fine, and so does passing a `Sparrow` to something expecting a `FlyingBird`.

> **NOTE:** Don’t force all subclasses to support behaviours they don’t share. Subtypes must **honor the expected behaviour** of their parent types.
