Java is a **platform-independent** (write once, run anywhere) **object-oriented** (class-based) programming language with **automatic memory management** (garbage collection), **strong** (static) typing, and a **rich standard library**.

---
### Platform-Independent

The same source code is compatible with all runtime environments, i.e., can run on various operating systems and hardware architectures without requiring modifications.

---
### Object-Oriented Language

Model real-world entities as objects, each encapsulating its own data (attributes) and actions (methods), and use them as the fundamental building blocks of your code.

---
### Garbage Collection

---
### Strong Typing

The data type of each variable needs to be declared explicitly so that the compiler can perform type checking at compile time, catching potential errors early in the development process and preventing runtime issues.

---
### Rich Standard Library

It is largely open-source, with **OpenJDK** being the reference implementation.

> **OpenJDK:** Stands for **Open Java Development Kit**. It’s an open-source implementation of the Java Platform **(Java Standard Edition)**, developed by Oracle for creating Java applications.
