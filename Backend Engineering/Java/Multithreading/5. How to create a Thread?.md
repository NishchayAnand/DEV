Java provides built-in support for multithreading via the `java.lang.Thread` class and the `Runnable` interface, allowing you to create and launch **separate threads** of execution. 

> **NOTE:** Each thread has its **own call stack** that allows it to run concurrently with the main thread.

### Extending the Thread class

Represents a thread of execution. It **has a lot of overhead** and responsibilities like managing the thread's lifecycle.

```
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();  // starts a new thread
    }
}
```

---
### Implementing the Runnable Interface

A Thread object needs a job. A job that the thread will run when the thread is started. A thread's jobs can be defined in any class that implements the `Runnable` interface.

```
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable thread is running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t1.start();
    }
}
```

When you pass a `Runnable` to a `Thread` constructor, you're really just giving the `Thread` a way to get to a `run()` method (define the code that we want the thread to execute).

> **NOTE:** Runnable is the job a thread is supposed to run.
