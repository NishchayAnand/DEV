1. `Thread t = new Thread(r);`: A `Thread` instance has been created but not started **(initial state)**. In other words, there's a `Thread` object, but no thread of execution.

2. `t.start();`: When you start the thread, it moves to the **Runnable state**. This means the thread is ready to run and just waiting for its chance to be selected for execution. At this point, there is a new call stack for this thread.

3. In the **Running state** state, a thread (and ONLY this thread) has an active call stack, and the method on the top of the stack is executing.
