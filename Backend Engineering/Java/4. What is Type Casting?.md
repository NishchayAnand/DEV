**Type casting** is the process of **converting a variable from one data type to another**. It is commonly done to ensure compatibility when performing **operations** involving **different data types** or when working with **inheritance hierarchies**.

Java supports two types of casting: **implicit (automatic) casting** and **explicit (manual) casting**.

### Implicit Casting - Widening Conversion

Implicit casting is the process of converting a **smaller data type** into a **larger data type**. It is done automatically by the compiler. 

**Syntax:**

```
largerType variableName = smallerTypeValue;
```

**Primitive Data Type:**

```
int a = 100;
double b = a;  // Widening: int to double
```

**Reference Data Type:**

```
Dog d = new Dog();
Animal a = d;  // Upcasting
```

> **NOTE:** Implicit casting is safe and does not result in data loss.

### Explicit Casting - Narrowing Conversion

Explicit casting is the process of converting a **larger data type** into a **smaller data type**. It needs to be done manually by the programmer.

**Syntax:**

```
smallerType variableName = (smallerType) largerTypeValue;
```

**Primitve Data Type:**

```
double x = 9.78;
int y = (int) x;  // double to int (fractional part lost)
```

**Reference Data Type:**

```
Animal a = new Dog();
Dog d = (Dog) a;  // Downcasting
```

> **NOTE:** Explicit casting can result in data loss, so it must be done manually.

**Q. What will be the output of the following code snippet?**

```
int x = 130;
byte y = (byte) x;
System.out.println(y);
```

**Output:** `-126`
