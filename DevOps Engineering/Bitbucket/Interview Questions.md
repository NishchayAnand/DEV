# Bitbucket Interview Questions

Q. Explain Bitbucket Pipelines. 

Bitbucket Pipelines is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tool integrated into Bitbucket. 

It enables developers to build, test, and deploy their code directly from their repositories using a YAML-based configuration file.

> NOTE: Bitbucket Pipelines natively supports Docker containers to run builds in isolated environments and easily integrates with tools like Jira, Slack, AWS, GCP, and Azure.
