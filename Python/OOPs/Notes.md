# Understanding OOPs in Python

## Constructor

A special method named **init** act as the constructor in Python. By convention, the first argument of the **init** method is usually named **self**. It's a reference to the newly created object and can be used to access and modify the object's attributes.

> **NOTE:** Python doesn't strictly enforce presence of an "**init**" method in a class definition.
