# SQL Cheatsheet

- `DISTINCT`: Used to retrieve unique values from a selected column or set of columns in your query results. You can specify multiple columns after **DISTINCT** to ensure uniqueness across all of them.

- `LEFT JOIN`: Includes all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If there's no match in the right table for a left table row, it will return null values for the right table's columns.

- `INNER JOIN`: Selects records that have matching values in both tables.

> NOTE: **_INNER JOIN_** is the default join type. If you simply specify **_JOIN_** after the table name, it's implicitly treated as an inner join.

- `GROUP BY`:

- `HAVING`:
