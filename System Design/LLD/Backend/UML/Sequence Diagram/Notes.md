# Understanding UML Sequence Diagram

A sequence diagram is a visual representation of how objects interact with each other over time. It's a type of interaction diagram used in software engineering to understand and document the behavior of a system.

In simple words, they are used to show the **sequence of events**.

Creating multiple sequence diagrams is common practice in software development. Each diagram should focus on a specific scenario or use case. For example, a e-commerce system might have separate sequence diagrams for `Placing an order`, `Processing a payment`, `Handling returns`, `Managing customer accounts` etc.

## Key Components

- **Objects/Participants:** Represented by rectangles placed horizontally across the top of the diagram. Each object has a lifeline, depicted as a dashed vertical line.

- **Lifelines:** Vertical dashed lines that show the lifespan of an object during the interaction. Time progresses from top to bottom along the lifeline.

- **Messages:** Horizontal arrows between lifelines that indicate communication between objects. Solid arrows represent synchronous messages (where the sender waits for a response). Dashed arrows represent asynchronous messages (where the sender does not wait for a response).

- **Return messages:** Dashed lines that show the return or response from a message call.

- **Activation Bars:** Thin rectangles on a lifeline that show when an object is active, i.e., executing a method or operation.

## How to create a Sequence Diagram

- Determine the objects that will be interacting within the system or process.
- Create vertical dashed lines below each object to represent their lifelines.
- Use horizontal lines between lifelines to show messages.
- Use dashed lines to indicate responses to messages.
- Add activation bars on lifelines where objects are active or processing messages.
