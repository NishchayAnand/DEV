# Low Level Design Interview Questions

Q. What is DAO layer?

A DAO layer, or Data Access Object layer, is an architectural pattern that **separates the database access logic from the business logic** in an application.

The DAO allows data access mechanisms to change independently of the code that uses the data.

Q. Difference between DAO and DTO?

**DAO** is a design pattern used to abstract and encapsulate all access to a data source (like a database). 

**DTO** is an object used to transfer data between layers. It allows us to control and limit the information that is exposed or transferred between different layers or components of an application.
