## Factory Pattern Interview Questions

**Q. Difference between Simple Factory Pattern and Factory Method Pattern.**

In Simple Factory Pattern, the factory object is responsible for object creation.

In Factory Method Pattern, the factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses. With factory method, the creator is not tightly coupled to any concrete product.

In simple words, the Simple Factory Pattern centralizes object creation in a single factory class, while the Factory Method Pattern decentralizes it by delegating object creation to subclasses, providing more flexibility and adherence to object-oriented design principles.
