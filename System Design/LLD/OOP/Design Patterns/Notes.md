# Understanding Design Patterns

- Patterns are discovered, not created.

- Behavior can also be encapsulated.

- One of the biggest problem with software designing to deal with change. Software that is not designed well breaks easily at the first sight of change.

- Can be categorised into 3 categories based on purpose:

- **Creational:** Related to object instantiation, providing a way to decouple the code that creates the object from the object itself.
- **Structural:** Describe how classes and objects are composed to create new structures and functionalities.
- **Behavioral:** Describe how objects or classes should communicate, as well as their responsibilities.

- Patterns can be classfied based on scope:

  - Class:

    - describe how relationship between classes are primarily defined via inheritance.
    - these relationships are defined at compile-time.
    - Interpreter, Factory Method, Adapter and Template Method fall under class design patterns.

  - Object:
    - describe relationships between objects that are primarilt defined by composition.
    - these relationships are created at runtime and are more dynamic and flexible than the ones defined by inheritance.

- Most of the design patterns are about replacing inheritance with composition.
