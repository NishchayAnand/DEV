# Understanding Proxy Design Pattern

Proxy patterns provide an intermediate object that is used to make a request to an endpoint object. Clients use the proxy, which, depending on certain configurable parameters, contacts the endpoint object.

Acts as an intermediary for accessing an object. It controls how clients interact with the real object, providing an extra layer of control.

The Proxy Design Pattern provides a way to create a "surrogate" or "wrapper" object that controls access to another object. This proxy object intercepts method calls made on the original object and potentially modifies them before or after execution.

Dynamic Proxies as Implementation:

Proxy Object: The dynamically generated class in a dynamic proxy acts as the proxy object, fulfilling the role of the "wrapper" around the target object.
Invocation Handler: The InvocationHandler interface defines the logic for intercepting and potentially modifying method calls. This corresponds to the additional functionality that the proxy object can inject into the interactions with the target object.
Target Object: The actual object whose methods are being intercepted remains the target object in the Proxy Design Pattern analogy.

Reduced Boilerplate: Java provides built-in mechanisms for creating proxy classes and managing invocation handlers, eliminating the need for manual class generation as might be done in a traditional implementation of the Proxy Design Pattern.

dynamic proxies leverage the Proxy Design Pattern principles by providing a more convenient and standardized way to implement them in Java. They offer a powerful mechanism for adding functionalities like security, logging, or performance monitoring without modifying the target object's code.

Imagine a security guard acting as a proxy for a building entrance (target object). The guard (proxy object) intercepts everyone entering (method call) and checks their credentials (invocation handler) before allowing access. Dynamic proxies provide a built-in mechanism for creating and managing these security guards for your objects in Java.
