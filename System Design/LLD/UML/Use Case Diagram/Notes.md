# Understanding Use Case Diagram

A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation of how users interact with a **system**. It's a way to capture the system's functionality from the user's perspective, focusing on what the system does rather than how it does it.

They use **actors (users or external systems)** and **use cases (actions users perform)** to depict **interactions (relationships)**.

> NOTE: Use Case Diagrams provide a high-level overview of the system's functionality, not the internal workings.

## Actors

- **Primary Actor:** Initiates the use of the system.
- **Secondary Actors:** Reactionary.
