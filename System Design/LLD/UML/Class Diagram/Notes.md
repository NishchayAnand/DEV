# Understanding UML Class Diagram

A UML class diagram is a blueprint for object-oriented systems. It visually represents the building blocks of a system: **the classes, their attributes, the actions they can perform (methods), and the relationships between them.**

**Visibility:** Sets the accessibility for that attribute or method. UML allows us to use different symbols to represent different access levels. For example,

1. `-` represents **private**
2. `+` represents **public**
3. `#` represents **protected**
4. `~` represents package/default.

**Multiplicity:** Allows you to set numerical constraints on your relationships. Types of multiplicity include:

1. `0..1`: Zero to One
2. `0..*`: Zero to Many
3. `1..*`: One to Many
4. `n`: Specific Number
5. `m..n`: Specific Number Range
