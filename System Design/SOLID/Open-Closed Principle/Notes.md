# Understandind Open-Closed Principle

- Classes should be resilient. This is good because it allows later for new features to be added to software without changing existing code. That idea is often formalized in the Open-Closed Principle.

- Open-Closed Principle: "Classes and methods should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

- The reasoning behind this is to avoid modifying existing code because client code depends on it, but to allow it to be extended because extensions are a necessary response to new requirements.
