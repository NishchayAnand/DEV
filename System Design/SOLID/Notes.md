# Understanding SOLID

SOLID is an acronym for five key principles in object-oriented design:

- **Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.** This means that a class should focus on a single functionality and avoid having multiple unrelated responsibilities.

- **Open-Closed Principle:** Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to extend the functionality of your code without having to modify the existing codebase.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle:** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without altering the program's correctness. In simpler terms, if you have a base class and derived classes, you should be able to use a derived class wherever you can use the base class.

- **Interface Segregation Principle:** Clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they don't use. Large interfaces with many methods can be cumbersome for clients that only need a subset of the functionality. This principle suggests breaking down large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This principle encourages relying on interfaces or abstractions rather than concrete implementations. This allows for more flexibility and easier swapping of components.
