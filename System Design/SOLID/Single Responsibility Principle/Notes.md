# Understanding Single Responsibility Principle

- Classes should be immutable.

- The purpose of "encapsulation" is to isolate changes to a single component.

- Assigning Responsibilities involve deciding what methods need to be defined and what class should expose them.

- Object-oriented design always aim to restrict the reponsibility of each class.

- Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.

- Classes can be made immutable by removing the setter methods. Clients can make copy of encapsulated data that their end and work with it there.
