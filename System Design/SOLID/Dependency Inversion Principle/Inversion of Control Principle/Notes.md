# Understanding Inversion of Control Principle

Inversion of Control Principle (IoC) comes into play as a way to achieve this Dependency Inversion Principle. By using IoC techniques like dependency injection, you don't create and manage the dependencies (low-level objects) within your high-level code. Instead, the high-level code specifies the abstractions it needs, and the IoC container (or some other mechanism) injects the concrete implementations at runtime.
