# Understanding System Design

- throughput

- resiliency

- single point of failure: keep backups and avoid single point of failures (master-slave architecture)

- vertical scaling

- horizontal scaling: employ microservice architecture for efficient horizontal scaling.

- Partitioning

- Load Balancer

- Logging and Metrics Calculations
