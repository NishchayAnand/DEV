Master-slave mode of replication is a built-in feature of many relational databases. However, it is also used in some non-relational databases, including MongoDB. 

Leader-based replication is not limited to databases. Distributed message brokers such as Kafka and RabbitMQ also use it. 

> NOTE: Normally, replication is quite fast. Most database systems apply changes to followers in less than a second.
