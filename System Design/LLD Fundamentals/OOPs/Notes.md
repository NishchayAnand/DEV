# What is Object-Oriented Programming?

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the ideology of representing real-world entities through self-contained units, each encapsulating its own state (attributes or fields describing the entity) and behavior (methods that allow users to operate on the entity).

Object-Oriented approach of programming offers a more intuitive and structured way of designing and organizing code, making it suitable for building large and complex applications.

The key building blocks of OOPs include:

- **Classes:** serves as a blueprint for creating self-contained units.
- **Objects:** an instance of a class, representing a self-contained unit possessing its own attributes and methods.

The four principles of OOPs – `Inheritance`, `Polymorphism`, `Abstraction`, and `Encapsulation` – serve as the **foundational pillars** that contribute to the creation of well-structured, reusable, and maintainable code.

EXTRA:

- Classes encapsulate fine-grained concepts of a problem and solution, whereas objects represent instances of classes created during the runtime operation of a system.
