# Understanding Decorator Design Pattern

- Decorators add value to one or more method calls before forwarding it (for example, verfying a payment before calling the execute() method).

- The Decorator pattern (GoF) allows the addition of custom behavior before and after (around, in AOP terminology) a method invocation.

- The Decorator is a useful pattern, but requires coding a custom decorator per target class.
