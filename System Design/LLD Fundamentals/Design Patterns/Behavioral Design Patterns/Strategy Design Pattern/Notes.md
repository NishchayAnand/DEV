# Understanding Strategy Pattern

- The idea of the Strategy Pattern is for a given interface to assign different variants of an algorithm to different implementations with the choice of which to choose being made at runtime.

- The DAO pattern is a special case of the Strategy design pattern (GoF), in which a specific implementation "strategy" is refactored into an interface to allow it to be changed independently of the coarser-grained object. The Strategy pattern plays a big part in well-designed OO applications, so there's much value in making it as easy as possible to use.

- JNDI Lookup is also based on the Strategy Design Pattern.

- Strategy patterns encapsulate interchangeable underlying algorithms and provide the same interface for accessing such algorithms. A strategy pattern is similar to an adapter pattern, but it is mainly used to provide pluggable policies and algorithmic processing modules in a design.
