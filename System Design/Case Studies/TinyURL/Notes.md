# TinyURL System Design

Design a **URL shortening service** that converts a long URL into a shorter, more manageable link. 

---
## Functional Requirements

1. **URL Shortening:** Take a long URL (e.g., `https://www.somewebsite.com/articles/how-to-design-a-url-shortener`) and create an alias with shorter length (e.g., `https://tinyURL/abc123`).

2. **URL Redirecting:** Retrieve the original URL from the shortened version.

> **NOTE:** A URL shortening service can also **handle custom alias creation** or **provide insights on link clicks, location, and user engagement.**

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Availability:**

2. **Scalability:**

3. **Partition Tolerance:**
