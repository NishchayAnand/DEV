## Functional Requirements

1. **URL Shortening:** Take a long URL and create an alias with shorter length.

2. **URL Redirecting:** Retrieve the original URL from the shortened version.

> **NOTE:** A URL shortening service can also **handle custom alias creation** or **provide insights on link clicks, location, and user engagement.**
