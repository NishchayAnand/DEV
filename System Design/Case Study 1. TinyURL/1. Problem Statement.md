Design a **URL shortening service** that converts a long URL into a shorter, more manageable link.

---
### Functional Requirements

1. **URL Shortening:** Take a long URL and create an alias with shorter length.

2. **URL Redirecting:** Redirect a short URL to the corresponding long URL.

> **NOTE:** A URL shortening service can also **handle custom alias creation** or **provide insights on link clicks, location, and user engagement.**

---
### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Availability:** The system should ensure that users can always access the shortened URLs. 

2. **Low latency:** The system should fetch the long URL and redirect users instantly.

3. **Scalability:** The system should be capable of handling a traffic volume of **10 Million URL generation requests** and **1 Billion redirection requests per day** (assuming **read / write ratio** is **100:1**).
