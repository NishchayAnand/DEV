We need to design a **minimal**, **responsive**, and **user-friendly** frontend interface that allows users to quickly shorten URLs, view their shortened links, and manage them if signed in.

---
### Functional Requirement

The UI would primarily consist of the following screens:

<span style="color:green;"><strong>Landing Page:</strong></span> Centered interface where users can input a long URL and click a `Shorten URL` button to generate a short link. Once the URL is shortened, it is immediately displayed with a `Copy` button for easy sharing. The page should include a simple header with branding and optional `Sign In` / `Sign Up` links, along with a minimal footer containing legal information.

<span style="color:green;"><strong>User Dashboard (for logged-in users):</strong></span> Presents a list view of all URLs the user has shortened. Each item shows the original URL, the corresponding short URL, and the number of times it has been accessed. Users can easily copy or delete any link from this dashboard.
