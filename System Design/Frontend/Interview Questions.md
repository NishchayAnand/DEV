Q. What is Application Shell?

A design pattern used in modern web applications to enhance performance and user experience. 

It refers to the minimal set of static assets (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) required to render the basic structure of an appâ€™s user interface (UI) without waiting for content to load dynamically.

> NOTE: An application shell typically includes navigation bars, headers, footers, and layout elements.
