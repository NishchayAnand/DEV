# Understanding CAP Theorem

The CAP theorem states that in any distributed data store, you can only achieve two out of the following three guarantees simultaneously:

- **Consistency:** All nodes see the same data at the same time.

- **Availability:** Every request receives a (non-error) response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent write.

- **Partition Tolerance:** The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped or delayed by the network between nodes.

Understanding and choosing the right consistency model depends on the specific needs and constraints of the system being designed. For example, systems requiring immediate data accuracy might prioritize **strong consistency**, while systems needing high availability might opt for **eventual consistency**.
