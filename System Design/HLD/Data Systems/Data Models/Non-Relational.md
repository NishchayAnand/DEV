# Understanding Non-Relational Databases

Non-Relational databases are also called `NoSQL` databases (e.g. `Cassandra`, `Amazon Dynamo DB`). They might be the right choice if your requirement involves:

## Super-Low Latency

**Your application requires super-low lacency.**

## Unstructured Data

**Your data is unstructured,** or you do not have any relational data. You only need to serialize and deserialize data (e.g. JSON, XML, YAML).

## Large Dataset

You need to store a massive amount of data.
