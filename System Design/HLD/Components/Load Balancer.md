# Understanding Load Balancer

A load balancer evenly distributes the incoming traffic among web servers that are defined in the load-balancer set.

For better security, private IPs are used for communication between servers.

> NOTE: A private IP is an IP address reachable only between servers in the same network, however, it is unreachable over the Internet.
