## API Gateway

An API management tool that sits between a client and a collection of backend services. In simpler terms, an API gateway is a piece of software that intercepts API calls from a user and routes them to the appropriate backend service.

When a client makes a request, the API gateway breaks it into multiple requests, routes them to the right places, produces a response, and keeps track of everything.

It's a server that acts as a **single entry point** for all client requests. It is responsible for routing the requests to the appropriate service, managing security, and performing other functions like load balancing, request transformation, and rate limiting.
