# Understanding Spring

## What problems did Spring solved?

- Gave method level declarative services to POJOs.

- No more application servers or EJBs required.

Q2. Difference between Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) and Spring Beans? -> proxy design pattern

Spring introduced concepts like dependency injection and automatic resource management, allowing developers to focus on the core functionality of their application without writing repetitive boilerplate code.

- Application server vs web server
- Java EE container vs web container
- managed by Corporation vs open source

Spring, a popular Java framework for building enterprise applications, addresses a key challenge of early Java EE

- Spring is still using part of Jakarta EE.
- Specification (JPA), Implementation (Hibernate).

- Initially, Spring was based on one design pattern - proxy design pattern

- Spring use bytecode manipulation to generate proxies at runtime (bean magic).
