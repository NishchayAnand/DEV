# Understanding Spring Framework

Spring is an Application Framework, not a layer framework so it can be used at different levels of an application.

Spring includes several separate frameworks, including Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring Rest, etc.

The basic idea behind Spring is to simplify the traditional approach to design enterprise applications.

Spring handles the infrastructure so that you can focus on building your application. It also enables you to build applications from **plain old Java objects.**

The core problem for which the Spring framework provides support is **how do we assemble different services into an application?**

Objects from a Java application have dependencies between them. The Spring framework allows the possibility to define dependencies via configuration.
