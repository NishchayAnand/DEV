# Understanding Spring Framework

Spring Framework is a popular open-source framework for building enterprise applications in Java.

The first version of Spring, released in October 2002, was introduced as a lightweight alternative to J2EE. It provided a simpler and more flexible approach to enterprise Java development.

## Problems with J2EE that Spring solved

The Spring Framework addressed several key issues and limitations associated with J2EE. Here are some of the main problems with J2EE that Spring effectively solved:

### Restrictive Programming Model

Does not support lifecycle management of helper POJOs.

### Heavy Weight Container

Spring is an ecosystem of frameworks each solving a particular problem of enterprise development.

### Container Generated Code

Dynamic proxies using declarative programming is better than large codebase due to container generated code.
