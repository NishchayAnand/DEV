# Understanding Web Containers

- A web container, on the other hand, is an application that includes a web server as well as additional components like a servlet container, Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) container, and so forth.

Web Server: A web server can deliver various types of static content, including HTML files, images, CSS, JavaScript, and more. It essentially serves files from the server's filesystem based on the request.

Web Container: A web container primarily deals with dynamic content. It processes requests for servlets and JSPs, which are Java programs that can generate content on the fly, access databases, and interact with other resources.

Examples of web containers include Tomcat, Glassfish, JBoss Application Server, or Wildfly.A web container, on the other hand, is an application that includes a web server as well as additional components like a servlet container, Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) container, and so forth.

Web containers aimed to separate the web presentation layer (servlets and JSP) from the underlying server infrastructure.

Web containers provided essential services like session management, security, and lifecycle management for web components, simplifying development and ensuring consistency across different server environments.

A web server like Apache can be configured to use a web container like Tomcat to handle requests for servlets and JSPs. The web server acts as the entry point, and the web container takes over for dynamic content generation.

In essence, web servers handle the core mechanics of HTTP communication and deliver static content, while web containers are specialists in processing requests for dynamic content generation using Java technologies.
