# Understanding Exception Handling in Java

## Types of Exceptions:

### Checked exceptions:

- Can be identified at the compile stage.
- Developers are required to handle checked exceptions before hand.
- Example: `FileNotFoundException`

### Unchecked exceptions:

- Come up when the program is running.
- Example: `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`
