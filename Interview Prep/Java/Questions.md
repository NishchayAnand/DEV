# Interview Questions

### Q. Write a solution to sort strings based on their length. If the length of two strings are equal, compare the two strings aphabetically.

We can create a custom comparator (by implementing `Comparator` interface) to define custom sorting logic for strings objects.

```
import java.util.Comparator;

public class CustomComparator implements Comparator<String> {
    @Override
    public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
        int lengthDifference = Integer.compare(s1.length(), s2.length());
        if (lengthDifference == 0) {
            return s1.compareTo(s2);
        }
        return lengthDifference;
    }
}
```

### Q. Why is Java a platform independent language?

Java is a compile-type language. The compiled code, i.e, bytecode can run on various operating systems and hardware infrastructures without requiring modifications.

---

### Q. What is Stack Memory?

Stack memory is a specific area of memory in a computer's RAM (Random Access Memory) that stores temporary variables created by each function.

---

### Q. What is classpath?

The `classpath` is an **environment variable** that tells the Java compiler and JVM where to look for compiled class files (.class) when running your program.

### Q. What were the differences between `Abstract Classes` and `Interfaces` before Java 8?

Before Java 8, the differences between abstract classes and interfaces in Java were more pronounced. Here are the key distinctions:

**Abstract Classes:**

1. **Abstract classes can have both abstract methods (methods without an implementation) and concrete methods (methods with an implementation).** Concrete methods in abstract classes can provide a default behavior that subclasses can use or override.

2. **Abstract classes can have instance variables (fields) with various access modifiers** (private, protected, public).

3. A **class can inherit from only one abstract class** due to Javaâ€™s single inheritance constraint.

4. **Methods** in abstract classes **can have any access modifier**: private, protected, public, or package-private (default).

5. Though Abstract classes cannote be instantiated, they can have constructors, which can be used to initialize fields in the abstract class. Subclasses can call the constructor of the abstract class using super().

**Interfaces:**

1. Interfaces could only have abstract methods (methods without an implementation).

2. Interfaces cannot have any instance variables (fields). We can **only define constants** which were implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`.

3. A class can implement multiple interfaces, **providing** a form of **multiple inheritance**.

4. All methods in interfaces were implicitly `public` and `abstract`.

5. Interfaces cannot have constructors because they cannot have any instance fields.

### Q3. What are the differences between `Abstract Classes` and `Interfaces` after Java 8?

After Java 8, the distinctions between abstract classes and interfaces have narrowed due to the introduction of `default` and `static` methods in interfaces. Here are the key distinctions:

1. **Abstract Classes can have instance variables that maintain instance-specific `state`, whereas Interfaces cannot.**

2. A class can only implement one Abstract Class whereas it can implement multiple Interfaces. **If a class implements multiple interfaces that have `default` methods with the same signature, the class must override the method to resolve the conflict.**

### Q. State the differences between equals() method and equals operator.

An object may contain multiple types of data. Using the equals (`==`) operator does not work for comparison of objects. Hence, we need to use equals() method. The equals() method compares the value.

---

### Q. What is Constant Pool?

The constant pool is a special area in memory where constant values are stored.

For strings, the constant pool plays a crucial role in memory management and performance optimization. When you create a **string literal (e.g., String s = "hello")**, the JVM first checks the constant pool. If the string already exists there, a reference to it is assigned to the variable s. If not, the string is added to the constant pool, and then a reference is assigned.

> **NOTE:** When you create a string using the **new keyword (e.g., String s = new String("hello"))**, a new string object is created in the heap memory, regardless of whether the string already exists in the constant pool.
